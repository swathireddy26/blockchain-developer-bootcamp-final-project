<h2> DAO Contributor Rewards platform: </h2>
It is a platform for DAOs to easily and fairly distribute resources to contributors. Community grants or internal salaries can all be recurrently rewarded by the community itself. Instead of cumbersome voting or black box committees, contributors themselves can quickly and transparently reward other contributors by the value they see being created.

<h2> Proposal: </h2>
1. Groups of DAO participants that wish to distribute funds through a decentralized gifting process can do this in epochs. Epochs are monthly events. <br />
2. Every contributor will be getting a fixed amount of GIVE tokens from treasury and can send any number of these tokens to other members freely during the Epoch. <br />
3. Members can also opt out if they recieve funding elsewhere, allowing them to send GIVE but not recieve it. <br />
4. GIVE has no value, if it is not given to another member. <br />
5. When the Epoch ends, the GIVE each member has recieved can be exchanged for a native DAO token amount of monthly treasury budget. <br />
6. By moving the decision making to the community, we can get valuable insights for the DAO about what the community finds most valuable, and who are the key contributors in different areas. <br />
